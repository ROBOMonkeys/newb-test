* Projects
** If-else projects
*** Vacation Budget program
- the program must accept a float as input, and depending on how large the number (your budget for vacation) is it will show different locations to travel to. If the budget is less than 2500.00 then it will show Canada. If it is between 2500.01 and 5000.00 it will show Hawaii. If it is between 5000.01 and 10000.00 it will show Rome. You will be using if-else statements to print out the differing responses. 
*** Last Name program
- the program will accept a string that is one of the programming team member's first name. Depending on what first name is input it will respond with the correct last name. However, when you input your own first name it should print out "The person who wrote this program!" or something similar. Use slack to get all the member's last names if you need to. This program will also use if-else statements to test the strings input by the user.
** List projects
*** Packing a Suitcase project
- this program will not take any input, but it will print out a list of items (as strings) that you would pack into a suitcase. However, you will need to write a function that will return a list. You should add at least 3 or more items in the list.
*** Unpacking the Suitcase project
- this project should use the same function as the list generation that you wrote for the last project. This program will need to print out the second object out of the suitcase. It should return it out of the list instead of just being printed out (e.g., don't just do "print("object2")")
** Loop projects
*** Manual Suitcase Packing project
- this program will take a single string as input. However, the string will have 3 or more words. The program will go and seperate each word out of the string and put them into a big list. This list will then be printed out. (HINT: To seperate the string by spaces use the split() function.) This program will require you to use a for loop.
*** Manual Suitcase Unpacking project
- this program will take a list (you may use the generator function from the last program, if you want) and it will print every string from the list on its own line. Do this using a for loop.
** Class projects
*** MyClass project
- this project will have you making your own class. It will be called MyClass and it will have a class variable called mine that is set to 0. It will have two functions, one called printMine and another called addToMine. addToMine will take a number as an argument and will add whatever number is given to it to the variable mine. printMine will simply print the variable mine.
*** Person Class project
- this project will have you make a class called Person. This Person class will have two functions, eat and sleep. eat will print "ate food today" and the sleep function will print "slept eight hours today". Next make a class called EmployeedPerson which will subclass the Person class. the EmployeedPerson class will have a modified sleep function, a new function called work and a variable named money. sleep will now print "slept 5 hours today", work will print out "worked 8 hours today and made $100" (or however much money you want) and it will add that number of money into the money variable.
